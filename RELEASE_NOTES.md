# BabyFlix

A **Plex-like desktop streaming app** for movies, series and live TV — built on the
**Xtream Codes API** (plus **M3U** playlists) with **automatic posters** and **key-free IMDb
ratings**. Native desktop app for **Windows, macOS and Linux** (Tauri 2 + React + Rust).

## 🆕 What's new in 1.1.0

- ⬇️ **FFmpeg is set up automatically.** If no system FFmpeg is found, BabyFlix downloads a
  static **FFmpeg + FFprobe** for your platform on first start (one-time, stored in the app
  data folder). **No Homebrew install needed on macOS.** An existing system install is still
  preferred.
- 🛠️ Builds on the 1.0.10 macOS fixes (FFmpeg lookup, plain-HTTP/ATS exemptions, visible
  playback errors with a Retry button).

## ✨ Highlights

- 🎬 **Movies / Series / Live TV** with categories, search and sorting
- 🔌 **Two login modes:** Xtream Codes and M3U playlist (fallback)
- 🖼️ **Automatic posters** (panel + IMDb) and ⭐ **real IMDb ratings** — no API key
- ▶️ **HLS player** with fullscreen, seeking, volume and keyboard shortcuts
- 📺 **Live TV** with channel logos and **EPG** (now / next)
- 📚 **Series** with seasons/episodes and autoplay of the next episode
- ⏱️ **Continue watching** and 🌍 **German / English** UI (switchable)
- 🔄 **Automatic updates** straight from these GitHub releases

updater artifacts). **macOS automatic updates require code signing** (Apple Developer
certificate + notarization); Windows and Linux auto-update work without OS code signing.

## 🔐 Privacy

Your credentials stay on your device. BabyFlix runs a local backend on `127.0.0.1` and talks
directly to your IPTV panel and to IMDb.

intended for **personal, non-commercial use only**.
