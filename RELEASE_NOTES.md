# BabyFlix

A **Plex-like desktop streaming app** for movies, series and live TV — built on the
**Xtream Codes API** (plus **M3U** playlists) with **automatic posters** and **key-free IMDb
ratings**. Native desktop app for **Windows, macOS and Linux** (Tauri 2 + React + Rust).

## 🆕 What's new in 1.2.0

- ⏭️ **Automatic next episode.** When an episode ends, the next one starts by itself — also
  across a season boundary. In the last 20 seconds a small **Up next** banner shows what is
  coming, with *Play now* and *Skip*.
- 💡 **Last watched episode is highlighted.** In a series, the season and series view mark the
  episode you watched last (accented card, *Last watched* badge, progress bar per episode), and
  the series opens on that season. The main button becomes **Resume: S1 · E2** and continues
  exactly there.
- 🛠️ **More reliable episode endings.** Streams that never report a proper "ended" event now
  still advance, and a chained episode always starts playing on its own.

## ✨ Highlights

- 🎬 **Movies / Series / Live TV** with categories, search and sorting
- 🔌 **Two login modes:** Xtream Codes and M3U playlist (fallback)
- 🖼️ **Automatic posters** (panel + IMDb) and ⭐ **real IMDb ratings** — no API key
- ▶️ **HLS player** with fullscreen, seeking, volume and keyboard shortcuts
- 📺 **Live TV** with channel logos and **EPG** (now / next)
- 📚 **Series** with seasons/episodes and autoplay of the next episode
- ⏱️ **Continue watching** and 🌍 **German / English** UI (switchable)
- 🔄 **Automatic updates** straight from these GitHub releases
